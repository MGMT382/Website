    <h1> Tracy and Tom's Total Travel </h1>
    <h2> <i>Our Story</i></h2>
<br>
We started our company in 2001 after our anniversary trip to Europe. We fell in love with traveling and wanted to share our passion with others.
<br> 
We knew we wanted to help others tackle international travel, so we created products and services to help. We know how stressful traveling is! 
<br>
That's why we are here to help you plan the trip of your dreams!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since opening our travel company, we have visitied some amazing places!
<br>
One of our favorites is Thailand! Here is a lovely picture we took in Phuket.

<br> 
We love to explore new places and find local cultures to explore. It is sometimes hard to plan out outings like this in foreign countries where you 
<br>
probably aren't fluent in the native language. We have spent many years perfecting our abilities to connect with individuals all around the world
<br> 
to give you the best experience possible.
