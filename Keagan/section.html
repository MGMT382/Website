    <h1> Tracy and Tom's Total Travel </h1>
    <h2> <i> <u>Our Story</u></i></h2>
<br>
We started our company in 2001 after our anniversary trip to Europe. We fell in love with traveling and wanted to share our passion with others.
<br> 
We knew we wanted to help others tackle international travel, so we created products and services to help. We know how stressful traveling is! 
<br>
That's why we are here to help you plan the trip of your dreams!
<br>
<br>
Being in our 20's when we began was a very difficult journey. Our knowledge and client base was so small and we could only help people plan trips 
to Europe. Since then, we have been able to expand our base and connect with people in over 75 countries! We look for natives as well as expert 
travelers to share their knowledge with us. Even after being open for 20 years, we still have so many places to explore ourselves! That's why we 
work with so many people around the globe to give you the best experience possible while abroad.
<br>
Since opening our travel company, we have visitied some amazing places!
<br>
One of our favorites is Thailand! Here is a lovely picture we took in Phuket.
