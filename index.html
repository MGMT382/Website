            <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
			<div>
				Immersive virtual reality (VR) is the focus of a current engineering grand challenge: Enhance Virtual Reality. Beyond recreation, VR simulations are becoming increasingly important for occupational 
				training, especially in remote or high-risk occupations. VR simulations usually allow the user to interact with virtual objects via camera-based appendage tracking, which is generally imprecise and 
				has positional jitter. Hence, there is a need to more accurately track a user’s appendages for a more realistic simulation of the user’s motions in a virtual environment. Haptic feedback in virtual 
				reality has countless applications in the future from training for many hands-on occupations to gaming with realistic environmental feedback; however, more current VR simulations do not provide 
				enough haptic feedback and preexisting VR simulators with haptic feedback are overly expensive and too bulky to allow fluid movement. These limitations have stunted the growth of the VR training 
				and recreational communities substantially.
			</div>

				RevEx is a non-optical virtual reality (VR) input device with haptic feedback that creates a more immersive VR experience. This system will contain a low-power wearable device that collects sensor 
				data and applies haptic feedback as well as a host computer running a dynamic VR simulation. The wearable also utilizes regenerative braking in conjunction with the haptic feedback to increase the 
				battery life.
